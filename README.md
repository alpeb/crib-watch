Crib Watch
===================

This program triggers an alarm 5 minutes after someone has forgotten to close the baby's crib gate. It interfaces with a [Phidgets USB interface kit](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1011) connected to a [magnetic switch](http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=3562) that I glued between the gate and the crib.
